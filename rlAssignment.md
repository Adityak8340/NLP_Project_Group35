# Assignment: Autonomous Drone Navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent drone navigation system using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The system will enable drones to autonomously navigate through complex environments, avoiding obstacles and adapting to varying weather conditions while optimizing for efficient delivery.

## Methodology: Deep Reinforcement Learning

DRL is chosen for this task due to its ability to learn optimal policies through interaction with the environment. This approach allows the drone to continually improve its navigation strategies based on experience.

### Core Elements

1. **Environment Representation**
   - Drone's current position and velocity (3D coordinates)
   - Proximity to obstacles
   - Weather data (wind speed, precipitation)
   - Battery status
   - Target location

2. **Possible Actions**
   - Adjust speed and direction in 3D space
   - Modify orientation (yaw, pitch, roll)
   - Hover or land
   - Initiate return to base if battery is low

3. **Reward Structure**
   The drone receives rewards or penalties based on:
   - Time taken to reach the destination
   - Collision avoidance
   - Weather condition management
   - Energy efficiency
   - Delivery speed

   Example reward calculation:
   ```
   R = -a * flight_duration - b * collision_risk + c * goal_reached - d * weather_penalty
   ```
   (a, b, c, d are weighting factors)

4. **Decision-Making Algorithm**
   A neural network processes the drone's state and outputs the optimal action. Training can utilize algorithms such as:
   - Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
   - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
   - Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

5. **Simulation Platform**
   Utilize 3D simulation environments like AirSim or Gazebo to model realistic drone physics, obstacle scenarios, and weather patterns.

## DRL Algorithms for Consideration

1. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**
   - Estimates action values using a neural network
   - Best for discrete action spaces
   - Implements experience replay for efficient learning

2. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
   - Directly optimizes the navigation policy
   - Suitable for continuous control tasks
   - Balances exploration and exploitation effectively

3. **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**
   - Employs a probabilistic policy
   - Optimizes for both expected reward and entropy
   - Well-suited for complex, uncertain environments

## Implementation Process

1. **Simulation Setup**
   Create a virtual environment using AirSim or Gazebo to simulate drone dynamics and environmental factors.

2. **Training Protocol**
   - Initialize the drone at the warehouse
   - Generate random delivery destinations
   - Allow the drone to explore and learn from its actions
   - Use the reward function to provide feedback
   - Iterate through numerous episodes to refine the navigation policy

3. **Real-World Deployment**
   - Transfer the trained model to physical drones
   - Apply Sim2Real techniques to bridge simulation-reality gaps

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Sim2Real Transfer**
   Address discrepancies between simulated and real-world environments through careful calibration and adaptation.

2. **Safety Protocols**
   Incorporate strict safety constraints in the training process to ensure collision avoidance and maintain flight stability.

3. **Energy Management**
   Optimize the reward function to prioritize energy-efficient flight paths and decision-making.

4. **Environmental Adaptability**
   Ensure the system can handle dynamic obstacles (e.g., birds, other drones) and changing weather conditions.

## Technical Requirements

- PyTorch: To construct and train the DRL model
- NumPy: For numerical computations
- Matplotlib: For visualizing training progress and results

## Code Implementation

### Step 1: Set up the environment
```bash
pip install gym torch numpy matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Import necessary libraries
```python
import numpy as np
import random
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from collections import deque
import gym
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Step 3: Define the neural network architecture
```python
class DroneNavigationNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(DroneNavigationNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 64)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(64, output_dim)

    def forward(self, state):
        x = torch.relu(self.layer1(state))
        x = torch.relu(self.layer2(x))
        return self.layer3(x)
```

### Step 4: Implement the DRL agent
```python
class DroneAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        self.state_dim = state_dim
        self.action_dim = action_dim
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=10000)
        self.gamma = 0.99
        self.epsilon = 1.0
        self.epsilon_decay = 0.995
        self.epsilon_min = 0.01
        self.model = DroneNavigationNetwork(state_dim, action_dim)
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters())
        self.loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

    def store_transition(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        self.memory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

    def choose_action(self, state):
        if random.random() < self.epsilon:
            return random.randrange(self.action_dim)
        state_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(state)
        q_values = self.model(state_tensor)
        return torch.argmax(q_values).item()

    def learn(self, batch_size):
        if len(self.memory) < batch_size:
            return
        
        batch = random.sample(self.memory, batch_size)
        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)
        
        states = torch.FloatTensor(states)
        actions = torch.LongTensor(actions)
        rewards = torch.FloatTensor(rewards)
        next_states = torch.FloatTensor(next_states)
        dones = torch.FloatTensor(dones)
        
        current_q_values = self.model(states).gather(1, actions.unsqueeze(1))
        next_q_values = self.model(next_states).max(1)[0]
        target_q_values = rewards + (1 - dones) * self.gamma * next_q_values
        
        loss = self.loss_fn(current_q_values.squeeze(), target_q_values)
        
        self.optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()
        
        self.epsilon = max(self.epsilon_min, self.epsilon * self.epsilon_decay)
```

### Step 5: Training loop
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
    state_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]
    action_dim = env.action_space.n
    agent = DroneAgent(state_dim, action_dim)
    
    num_episodes = 1000
    batch_size = 64
    scores = []
    epsilon_values = []

    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        state, _ = env.reset()
        total_reward = 0
        done = False

        while not done:
            action = agent.choose_action(state)
            next_state, reward, done, _, _ = env.step(action)
            agent.store_transition(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
            state = next_state
            total_reward += reward

            agent.learn(batch_size)

        scores.append(total_reward)
        epsilon_values.append(agent.epsilon)

        if episode % 10 == 0:
            print(f"Episode {episode}, Score: {total_reward}, Epsilon: {agent.epsilon:.2f}")

    env.close()

    # Moving average plot
    window = 100
    moving_avg = np.convolve(scores, np.ones(window)/window, mode='valid')
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.plot(moving_avg)
    plt.title(f'Average Score (Window: {window} episodes)')
